/// # Notes
///
/// This library made a concious decision to not work with "Date" elements from EBML due to lack of built-in support for dates in Rust. Specification implementations should treat Date elements as Binary so that consumers have the option of parsing the unaltered data using their library of choice, if needed.
///

// Possible future feature flag to enable Date functionality by having `chrono` as an optional dependency?
